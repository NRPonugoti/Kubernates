You will have set of pods which will be exposed via service and then we will have another set of pods which will be exposed via another service  
when we will do service exposer the problem is still have ipaddress follow with port name , when you go and give the detail someone , they don’t understand 

That’s why you will give human readable name that is provided the ingress controller 
And also we try to provide the load balancer when you talk in term of ingress controller 
Nginx ingress controller 

Ingress Adv: 

Ingress act as Load balancer 
Ingress has path based routing logic  and it has sub domain 

Ingress support path based routing 

First go and buy DNS name 
DNS resolver will help to convert into human readble name to Ipaddress and ip address to human readable name 


Nginx ingress controller :
It is also checking ssl and tls certificate which is valid or not, validating everything is here ans distribute the load as per url here 
It is act as load balancer 
It is act as security enhancer 
It is act as reverse proxy 

1.	DNS Resolver or Server : 
You type in browser www.google.com  DNS server is actually convert that google.com into relevant IP address 

Login Google cloud 
#kubectl delete all –all 
I am trying to achieve below set up
