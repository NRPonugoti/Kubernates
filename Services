Kubernetes – services -NodePort 
We can expose an application running on set of PODs using different types of services available in k8s 
1.clusterIp
Cluster Ip is specific to a cluster which means it is boundary is only cluster 
Inside Kubernetes cluster you can access your ports with clusterIP if you have created a clusterIP service for your port 
2.NodePort
Using nodes port whatever it is exposed using that port , you will able to access your application externally via internet 
3.Loadbalancer 
This is specifically for cloud providers like aws 

NodePort Service :
To access our application outside of k8s cluster , we can use NodePort service 
Expose the service on each worker Nodes Ip at static port nothing but Nodeport 
A cluster IP service , to which the NodePort service routes , is automatically created when ever Nodeport service is created 
Port range 30000-32767
You have K8s cluser  with Worker Node 
Then deployed your pod 
Created POD 
Then we have  created a NodePort Service 
What hppens 
In NodePort service you will have something called every service will have its own port so that is nothing but ClusterIp service Port 
So your pod port is 80 and your cluster ip service port is also 80 
Next thing is target port 
So in the service you will have the definition called port which is 80 which is nothing but the service port and target Port is nothing but container port in a pod 
So this is nothing but your respective pod port so this is pod port 80 
Next thing is worker NodePort, this is nothing but what ever starts from 30,000 to 32,767

NodePort = worker NodePort (worker node port)
targetPort = container port in pod 
port =cluster service port  


Practice :

Ports: 
Port: port on which node port service listens in k8s cluster internally ( clusterIP)
targetPort : we define container port here on which our application is running 
NodePort : Worker NodePort on which we can access our application 

Create pod :
#kubectl run <pod-name>  --image <container-name>  --generator=run-pod/v1
Expose pod as service
#kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=NodePort –port=80 –name =<service-name>
See all service 
#kubectl get svc 
#kubectl get nodes -o wide 
Access the application using public IP 
http://<node1-public-ip>:<Node-port>
•	mportant Note about: target-port
o	If target-port is not defined, by default and for convenience, the targetPort is set to the same value as the port field.
# Below command will fail when accessing the application, as service port (81) and container port (80) are different
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod  --type=NodePort --port=81 --name=my-first-service2     

# Expose Pod as a Service with Container Port (--taret-port)
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod  --type=NodePort --port=81 --target-port=80 --name=my-first-service3

# Get Service Info
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc

# Get Public IP of Worker Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide

Dump Pod logs :
#kubectl logs <pod-name>
Stream pod logs with -f 
#kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
Step-05: Interact with a Pod
Verify Pod Logs
# Get Pod Name
kubectl get po

# Dump Pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs my-first-pod

# Stream pod logs with -f option and access application to see logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs -f my-first-pod
•	Important Notes
o	Refer below link and search for Interacting with running Pods for additional log options
o	Troubleshooting skills are very important. So please go through all logging options available and master them.
o	Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/
Connect to Container in a POD
•	Connect to a Container in POD and execute commands
# Connect to Nginx Container in a POD
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- /bin/bash

# Execute some commands in Nginx container
ls
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
cat index.html
exit
•	Running individual commands in a Container
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> env

# Sample Commands
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod env
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod ls
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html


Step-06: Get YAML Output of Pod & Service
Get YAML Output
# Get pod definition YAML output
kubectl get pod my-first-pod -o yaml   

# Get service definition YAML output
kubectl get service my-first-service -o yaml   
Step-07: Clean-Up
# Get all Objects in default namespace
kubectl get all

# Delete Services
kubectl delete svc my-first-service
kubectl delete svc my-first-service2
kubectl delete svc my-first-service3

# Delete Pod
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod

# Get all Objects in default namespace
kubectl get all
