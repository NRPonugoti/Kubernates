Controller they are processes that monitor kubernates object and and respond accordingly 

1. Replication Controller :
So what is a replica and why do we need a replication controller?

Let's go back to our first scenario where we had a single pod running our application.
What if for some reason our application crashes and the pod fails?
Users will no longer be able to access our application.

To prevent users from losing access to our application,
we would like to have more than one instance or pod running at the same time.
That way if one fails we still have our application running on the other one.
  
The replication controller helps us run multiple instances of a single pod in the Kubernetes cluster
thats providing high availability
